## Questions

Go to `localhost:3000/teachers` in your browser; why does this not work?
This does not work because there are no routes that match a GET request to "/teachers" because we are using POST here instead.


What type of request did your browser just perform?
GET request


Go back to `localhost:3000/teachers/new`; submit the form again. What URL do you end up at?
localhost:3000/teachers


Why does `localhost:3000/teachers` work now?
There is a now an existing POST to '/teachers'.
